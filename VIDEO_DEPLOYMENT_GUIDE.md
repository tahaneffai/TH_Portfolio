# Video Deployment Guide

## Issue Identified
Your demo videos are not working in production due to Git LFS (Large File Storage) configuration. The `.gitattributes` file shows that `.mp4` files are stored in Git LFS, which may not be properly pulled during deployment on hosting platforms like Vercel.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Next.js Configuration Updates
- Added proper headers for video files with correct MIME types
- Configured caching for better performance
- Optimized static file serving

### 2. Enhanced Video Error Handling
- Added loading states for better UX
- Implemented comprehensive error messages
- Added fallback mechanisms for failed video loads

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Loading spinners during video load
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting tips
- Better state management for demo modals

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Remove Git LFS for Videos (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove LFS tracking for video files
git lfs untrack "*.mp4"
git rm --cached public/projects/*.mp4
git add public/projects/*.mp4
git commit -m "Remove LFS tracking for video files"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Use External Video Hosting (Best for Large Files)
Consider uploading videos to:
- YouTube (unlisted)
- Vimeo
- Cloudinary
- AWS S3

Then update the video sources in `src/components/sections/Projects.tsx`:
```typescript
demo: { type: 'video', src: 'https://your-video-url.mp4' }
```

### Option 3: Optimize Video Files
- Compress videos using tools like HandBrake
- Convert to WebM format for better web compatibility
- Use multiple formats for better browser support

## Testing
1. Deploy to your hosting platform
2. Test video loading in production
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify video files are accessible via direct URL

## Troubleshooting
If videos still don't work:
1. Check if video files are accessible via direct URL
2. Verify file sizes are within hosting limits
3. Consider using a CDN for better performance
4. Check browser compatibility for video formats
